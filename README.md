# EDA-Emergency-Department-Operations-analysis

The Emergency Department (ED) plays a critical role in patient care, often operating under immense pressure with limited resources.
This project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the EDâ€™s operational data for January 2024 at ABC Hospital, India.
The primary objective of the analysis is to uncover insights into patient demographics, waiting times, triage levels, and patient outcomes. By identifying patterns and inefficiencies, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can improve overall efficiency and patient care in the ED.
